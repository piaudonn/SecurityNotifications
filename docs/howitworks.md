## Module's framework

The modules are always composed of 4 sections delimited in [scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-control-flow-run-steps-group-scopes).
1.	**Config** is initializing the module, get its timestamp for the query and get its configuration from the Config logic app.
2.	**Query** is where the KQL query is defined and executed.
3.	**Notification** is where the results of the query are parsed, and an email is sent to the final recipients according to the moduleâ€™s config.
4.	**Exit** is to update the timestamp for the next execution.

The **Config LA** is designed to retrieve the configuration for the caller module. It will get this configuration by reader the configuration files from the storage account. The config is also retrieve the email template for the caller module.

The **Notification LA** sole purpose is to send email. Tracked properties allow statistics gathering if the integration to Log Analytics is enabled.
