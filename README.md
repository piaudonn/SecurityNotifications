## SEcurity End-user Notification (SEEN) ðŸ‘€

### Project description

Consumer identity platforms are notifying their users when their password has changed, a suspicious logon is detected, or a new MFA method was added. It is also a common practice in the insurance and financial industries. Yet, our enterprise solution Azure AD does not have these capabilities.

This project is leveraging a combination of Logic Apps to enable customers to quickly set up those notifications using ready to go (and customizable) email templates. 

These notifications encourage end-users to contact their support if the action which was detected does not seem to be legitimate. This will help supports and security operations in their investigations and security decisions. 

### Supported scenarios

Here is the list of activities which SEEN can use to trigger end-user notifications:
- Multi Factor Authentication methods updates
- Temporary Access Pass creations and usage

Scenarios are implemented through modules (Logic Apps with a Recurrence trigger).

The operators of the solution can customize the email templates that will be used to notify users per scenario.

### Deployment

The deployement of the solution is in two phases:
1. Deploy the ARM template to create the resources in your Azure subscription 
2. Run Setup Script which configure permissions and import the default configuration

The full solution is available for deployment in the [Deployment](/deploy/) section and additional documentation can be found in [Docs](/docs/).

If you have any questions about this project or would like to provide suggestions to the SEEN project maintainers please open an [issue](https://github.com/piaudonn/SecurityNotifications/issues/new/choose).
